# BlazorTodoSample
This is a really simple Todo application build using [Blazor](https://blazor.net). See my [dotnetFlix episode](http://dotnetflix.com/player/73) for more details.

To run it, make sure you have the [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) installed (or a later version) and run the following command:

```
dotnet run
```

Then point your browser at http://localhost:5000 or https://localhost:5001/
